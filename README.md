### PiggyBank Smart Contract frontend app

- **Please be aware that this template uses the older Elrond dapp library.** The newest one is here: [dapp-core](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/dapp-core). 
- **Also the new frontend** will be build soon. Based on: [nextjs-dapp-template](https://github.com/ElrondDevGuild/nextjs-dapp-template).

PiggyBank is a custom Smart Contract on the Elrond blockchain. If you want to know more about preparing and deploying such a Smart Contract, check out separate [blog post](https://www.julian.io/articles/elrond-smart-contracts.html). Here we have a frontend app for it.

Remember that the devnet will be restarted from time to time. It could mean that preconfigured PiggyBank Smart Contract will stop working. I'll try to redeploy a new one in such a case, but this won't be automatic.

**This app is for learning and demonstration purposes only.**

#### How to start with local instance

1. Clone the repo
1. Remember to configure the .env file. Review and copy `.env.example` into `.env.local`
2. In `.env.local` configure your PiggyBank Smart Contract address. (Check how to deploy your custom one [here](https://www.julian.io/articles/elrond-smart-contracts.html). You can also use the one from this repo (of course if the devnet isn't restarted yet)).
3. You would also need some xEGLD on the devnet. You should be able to use a web wallet's built-in faucet. Or there is also one for the devnet [here](https://r3d4.fr/elrond/devnet/).
